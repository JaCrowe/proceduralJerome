# proceduralJerome

## _WARNING_ If you came here for clean, properly architected code you've come to the WRONG place. You could consider this project physiotherapy for Jerome's atrophied c++/openGL muscles.

### Build Instructions

#### Dependencies

- OpenGL 3.2
- SDL 2
- g++ 7.5.0

If you're developing on mac this will probably work. If you're stuck developing on windows then I'm sorry.
