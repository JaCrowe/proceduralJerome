# proceduralJerome

## _WARNING_ If you came here for clean, properly architected code you've come to the WRONG place. You could consider this project physiotherapy for Jerome's atrophied c++/openGL muscles.

### Build Instructions

#### Dependencies

- OpenGL 3.2
- SDL 2
- g++ 7.5.0
- GNU Make 4.1

#### Compilation

Assuming you're running on Linux or Mac

```bash
make
```

If you're stuck developing on windows then I hope their little bash terminal project they've been working on is far along enough for you to use.

#### Running

```bash
./proceduralJerome
```
