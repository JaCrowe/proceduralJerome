# proceduralJerome

## _WARNING_ If you came here for clean, properly architected code you've come to the WRONG place.

### Build Instructions

#### Dependencies

On Ubuntu 21
- libsdl2-dev
- libsdl2-image-dev
- libavcodec-dev
- libswscale-dev

The OpenGL dependencies will be installed with libsdl. 

#### Compilation

Assuming you're running on Linux

```bash
make
```

If you're developing on mac this will probably work. If you're stuck developing on windows then I'm sorry.

#### Running

```bash
./procedural_jerome
```
